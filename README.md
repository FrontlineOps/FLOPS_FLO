# FLO: Frontline Operations - Altis

**Current Version**: 1.5.1

A dynamic frontline operations mission for Arma 3 that creates an evolving battlefield with intelligent OPFOR forces, logistics systems, and garrison management.

## Features
- Dynamic frontline system with intelligent OPFOR forces
- Advanced logistics and supply network
- Garrison management system
- Intel gathering and radio tower control mechanics
- Automated resource management for OPFOR forces
- Dynamic vehicle spawning system
- Customizable faction loadouts and equipment

## Setup Instructions

### Basic Mission Setup
1. Download the mission files (MAKE SURE YOU UNPACK THE PBO)
2. Place in your Arma 3 missions folder: `Documents/Arma 3 (Or Other Profile)/missions/`
3. Load the mission in the Arma 3 editor to customize settings

### Faction Customization

#### OPFOR Forces Setup
- There are two ways to make factions. 
1. For people using it for individual Unit/Community Usage. I recommend using the files:
- `CUSTOM_CIVILIAN_FACTION, CUSTOM_FRIENDLY_FACTION, CUSTOM_ENEMY_FACTION`
2. Create a new faction file in `Scripts/factions/` (e.g., `opf_custom.sqf`) with the following structure. This is useful for people wanting to contribute to the Github by adding new factions that be used by everyone.

```sqf
// Vehicle Arrays
East_Ground_Vehicles_Light = [
    "O_MRAP_02_F",
    "O_MRAP_02_hmg_F"
];

East_Ground_Vehicles_Heavy = [
    "O_MBT_02_cannon_F",
    "O_APC_Tracked_02_cannon_F"
];

East_Air_Heli = [
    "O_Heli_Attack_02_F",
    "O_Heli_Light_02_F"
];

// Infantry Arrays
East_Units = [
    "O_Soldier_F",
    "O_Soldier_GL_F",
    "O_Soldier_AR_F"
];

// ... other arrays
```

#### CAS Aircraft Pylon Setup
To configure CAS aircraft pylons, find the Function called fn_AirSupport.sqf

```sqf
private _pylonMags = [
    "PylonRack_4Rnd_LG_scalpel",  // SCALPEL missiles
    "PylonRack_4Rnd_ACE_Hellfire_AGM114K",  // AGM-114K Hellfire
    "PylonRack_4Rnd_ACE_Hellfire_AGM114N",  // AGM-114N Hellfire
    "PylonRack_12Rnd_ACE_DAGR", // DAGR missiles 12x
    "PylonRack_24Rnd_ACE_DAGR", // DAGR missiles 24x
    "ace_hot_3_PylonRack_3Rnd", // HOT missiles 3x
    "ace_hot_3_PylonRack_4Rnd" // HOT missiles 4x
];
```

#### Artillery Configuration
Configure artillery munitions in fn_ArtilleryPrep.sqf

```sqf
private _artilleryMagazines = [
    "32Rnd_155mm_Mo_shells_O",
    "2Rnd_155mm_Mo_Cluster_O"
];
```

### Map Configuration

The mission uses both automatic and manual marker placement systems for setting up the battlefield. You have two options:

#### Option 1: Automatic Marker System
The mission includes an automatic marker system (`init_Markers.sqf`) that:
1. Places markers based on map features and objects
2. Scales marker density based on `EnemyPrec` parameter
3. Automatically identifies and marks:
   - Radio Towers (`loc_Transmitter`) near `LocationEvacPoint_F`
   - Support locations (`o_support`) near factories and military structures
   - Installations (`o_installation`, `n_installation`) in cities and capitals
   - Barracks (`loc_Ruin`) near military buildings
   - Radar sites (`loc_Power`) near radar structures
   - Armor positions (`o_armor`) near roads
   - AA positions (`o_antiair`) on high ground
   - Infantry positions (`o_inf`) in villages
   - Aircraft positions (`o_plane`) in suitable areas

Key features of the automatic system:
- Centers around `LocationEvacPoint_F` objects
- Uses terrain features like mountains for placement
- Maintains minimum distances between markers
- Adjusts marker density based on map size
- Automatically places military infrastructure

#### Map Conversion Tips
When converting the mission to a new map:

1. Adjust Enemy Presence:
- Default scale is based on map size: `worldSize / 2` (This determines how dense the map will be with objectives besides the Dialog Menu % of Map Playable.)

2. Infrastructure Placement:
- Place `LocationEvacPoint_F` objects for key strategic points
- Add military structures (`Land_Cargo_Tower`, `Land_Radar_F`, etc.)
- Place `Sign_Pointer_Blue_F` for factories/industrial areas

### Spawn Positions:
- Spawn Positions will be selected when you first join the mission as the Company Commander. You will be prompted with the Dialog Menu in which you can 
select Faction, Starting Aggression levels, Starting Civilian Relations, and More.

## Customization Tips

### Resource System
- Adjust OPFOR resource generation in `Functions/Logistics/fn_opforResources.sqf`

### Intel System
- Modify intel decay rates and bonuses in `Functions/Logistics/fn_intelSystem.sqf`
- Adjust radio tower benefits in the intel system

### Performance Settings
- Configure view distance in `initServer.sqf`
- Adjust dynamic spawning ranges in garrison manager

### Arsenal Customization
The mission uses a restricted arsenal system (`fn_restrictedArsenal.sqf`) that works with both ACE and vanilla arsenals. You can customize available equipment in the following categories:

#### Weapons and Attachments
```sqf
// Modify these arrays in fn_restrictedArsenal.sqf
private _rifles = [
    "arifle_MX_F",
    "arifle_MXC_F",
    // ... add or remove weapons
];

private _launchers = [
    "launch_B_Titan_F",
    // ... add or remove launchers
];

private _attachments = [
    "optic_Hamr",
    "acc_flashlight",
    // ... add or remove attachments
];
```

#### Equipment
```sqf
private _uniforms = [
    "U_B_CombatUniform_mcam",
    // ... add or remove uniforms
];

private _vests = [
    "V_PlateCarrier1_rgr",
    // ... add or remove vests
];

private _headgear = [
    "H_HelmetB",
    // ... add or remove headgear
];

private _backpacks = [
    "B_AssaultPack_mcamo",
    // ... add or remove backpacks
];
```

#### Items and Equipment
```sqf
private _medicalItems = [
    "kat_AFAK",
    // ... add or remove medical items
];

private _toolItems = [
    "ACE_CableTie",
    // ... add or remove tools
];

private _navigationItems = [
    "ItemMap",
    "ItemGPS",
    // ... add or remove navigation items
];
```

#### Ammunition and Explosives
```sqf
private _magazines = [
    "30Rnd_65x39_caseless_mag",
    // ... add or remove magazines
];

private _grenades = [
    "HandGrenade",
    "SmokeShell",
    // ... add or remove grenades
];
```

#### Implementation Notes:
1. The arsenal system automatically:
   - Works with both ACE and vanilla arsenals
   - Applies to all arsenal boxes, FOBs, and OPs
   - Updates dynamically when new FOBs/OPs are created

2. Mod Compatibility:
   - Supports ACE items and medical equipment
   - Compatible with TFAR radio systems
   - Works with KAT Advanced Medical items
   - Supports custom mod items (just add their classnames)

3. To add new items:
   - Find the appropriate category in `fn_restrictedArsenal.sqf`
   - Add the classname to the corresponding array
   - Items will be available in all arsenals automatically

4. Performance Optimization:
   - Arsenal restrictions are applied only once per box
   - Uses efficient event handlers to manage updates
   - Prevents duplicate initialization
